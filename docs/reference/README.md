# K98 Bot Reference Docs

This folder contains active project standards, operating runbooks, and domain references.
Do not read every file for every task. Use the tiers below.

## Required For Every Repo Task

Read these before implementation work:

- `../../README-DEV.md`
- `K98 Bot - Project Engineering Standards.md`
- `K98 Bot - Coding Execution Guidelines.md`
- `K98 Bot - Testing Standards.md`
- `K98 Bot - Skills & Refactor Triggers.md`
- `K98 Bot - Deferred Optimisation Framework.md`

Read the task brief, issue, or task pack before these documents when one exists.

## Conditional References

| Area | Reference |
|------|-----------|
| Deferred optimisation backlog | `deferred_optimisations.md` |
| Deferred optimisation batching/scoring | `K98 Bot Deferred Optimisation Scoring Model.md` |
| Command reference and command-surface governance | `canonical_command_reference.md` |
| Promotion or deployment | `Promotion Guide.md`, `runbook_devops.md` |
| Environment variables or runtime config | `ENV_REFERENCE.md` |
| Startup lifecycle | `runbook_startup.md`, `singleton_lock.md` |
| Shutdown/recovery lifecycle | `runbook_shutdown.md`, `singleton_lock.md` |
| Diagnostics, telemetry, offloads, queue recovery | `runbook_diagnostics.md` |
| Repo navigation | `runbook_structure.md` |
| Helper or shared utility changes | `REVIEW_HELPERS.md` |
| MGE work | `mge_reference_model.md` plus SQL repo validation |
| Honor ingestion | `honor_scan.md` |
| Event reminders and calendar reminders | `events_and_dm_reminders.md` |
| Weekly activity import | `weekly_activity_importer.md` |
| Security-sensitive work or Codex Security routing | root/applicable `SECURITY.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and the K98 security routing skill |

## Archive

Historical or consolidated notes live in `archive/`. Do not use archived files as active guidance.
Current standards and runbooks override archive content.

Archived examples include:

- historical quality automation task spec
- superseded helper standards note
- old rehydrate test note
- old operations note
- resolved deferred optimisation history

## Templates Live Elsewhere

Reusable task and initiation templates live in `../templates/`. Do not treat template generator
docs as mandatory reading unless the task is to create or update a task pack.

## SQL Source Of Truth

For SQL-facing work, validate object names, columns, procedures, views, indexes, and `ProcConfig`
usage against:

`C:\K98-bot-SQL-Server`

The SQL repo overrides inferred schema assumptions from Python code.
