### Deferred Optimisation
- Area: tests/stats_service.py, tests/targets_sql_cache_subproc.py, tests/prekvk_stats.py, tests/proc_config_import_phase2.py, tests/sheets_sync_flow.py
- Type: consistency
- Description: Several non-Ark unit tests still reach live SQL Server or connection construction when run in the Codex/local PR validation environment without the bot machine's ODBC setup.
- Suggested Fix: Add subsystem-specific DAL/service boundary patches or explicit integration markers, then gate live DB coverage behind RUN_DB_TESTS=1.
- Impact: high
- Risk: medium
- Dependencies: Agreement on which non-Ark tests should remain live DB integration coverage.

### Deferred Optimisation
- Area: tests/test_dl_bot_mge_auto_import.py, tests/test_integration_end_to_end_fake_worker.py, tests/test_maintenance_suite.py
- Type: consistency
- Description: Full-suite validation in the Codex/local PR environment has non-DB environment blockers: DL_bot expects venv/Scripts/python.exe while the documented command uses .venv, and subprocess worker tests fail with WinError 5 in the sandbox.
- Suggested Fix: Make startup interpreter validation configurable for tests and mark subprocess worker tests with an environment capability gate when process spawning is unavailable.
- Impact: medium
- Risk: medium
- Dependencies: Local validation environment contract for venv naming and subprocess permissions.

### Deferred Optimisation
- Area: commands/stats_cmds.py
- Type: architecture
- Description: Some KVK admin commands still contain direct operational SQL beyond the current-KVK resolver.
- Suggested Fix: Move scan/window/recompute SQL into a dedicated KVK admin DAL/service batch while preserving command output behaviour.
- Impact: medium
- Risk: medium
- Dependencies: Review KVK admin command coverage and decide the target service/DAL split for scan, window, export, and recompute operations.

### Deferred Optimisation
- Area: `DL_bot.py` PreKvK upload routing
- Type: architecture
- Description: PreKvK upload routing still lives in the legacy root bot listener with filename matching, current-KVK lookup, offload dispatch, and Discord response rendering mixed together.
- Suggested Fix: Move PreKvK upload routing into a dedicated route/service module and leave `DL_bot.py` responsible only for delegating the Discord event.
- Impact: medium
- Risk: medium
- Dependencies: PreKvK diagnostics result model should remain stable after the import-history rollout.

### Deferred Optimisation
- Area: SQL repo legacy PreKvK phase objects
- Type: cleanup
- Description: `dbo.PreKvk_Phases`, `dbo.fn_PreKvkPhaseDelta`, and KVK-specific phase views still represent the old scan-window delta model even though Python reporting now uses direct stage columns.
- Suggested Fix: Audit production SQL/report dependencies, then replace with direct-stage equivalents or retire the legacy objects in a separate SQL cleanup task.
- Impact: medium
- Risk: medium
- Dependencies: Confirm no production reports or manual SQL workflows still depend on scan-window phase objects.
